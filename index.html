        <p>The Prostate protocol is an online program that contains simple diet instructions for eliminating BPH. In the
          system, one will find essential foods and practices that kill BPH, and the results are irreversible. Scot
          Davis is the author of this fantastic program. Davis is a highly respected medical practitioner, and his
          tactics have helped thousands recover from BPH. &nbsp;The Prostate Protocol mainly targets men with BPH.
          Instructions offered in the system are dedicated to fighting the root cause of BPH. More interestingly, the
          program does not prevent anyone from talking about their favorite foods. One is guaranteed positive results
          within three weeks after starting using the program. The depletion of <a class="intexttaglink"
            data-tid="17002" href="/gut-bacteria.html">gut bacteria</a> causes BPH. Anyone in this state begins
          experiencing urinal challenges. On most occasions, a lack of gut cells results in enlargement of the prostate.
          Soon, one may also experience itching in the urinal duct as the condition worsens. The Prostate Protocol
          offers a simple solution many doctors may not be aware of. Reportedly, stress and tiresome jobs are also a
          significant cause of BPH. How can one control stress to avoid BPH? The right answers are in the Prostate
          Protocol. The system contains easy to follow tactics for <a class="intexttaglink" data-tid="9442"
            href="/managing-stress.html">managing stress</a>.</p>
        <p>Moreover, the program recommends special foods in supermarkets or grocery stores that help cure BPH. The
          foods are dedicated to feeding the gut bacteria and bringing them back to work again. Therefore, to
          effectively cure BPH, one must eat right the recommended foods. The Prostate Protocol is not an internet scam,
          as many may think. It is because the system has been tested and optimized to produce the best results. Also,
          thousands of people around the globe have used it, and their BPH is cured. The Prostate Protocol is also
          supported by Click bank. This gives anyone out there with BPH enough assurance that the system's quality and
          reliability is unquestionable.</p>

        <p>As the program indicates, deleted gut bacteria cause hormonal imbalance. In this case, the body simply gets
          an imbalance of Oestrogen and Testosterone hormones. Eventually, one may be easily exposed to BPH attacks.
          Reportedly, many men spend thousands of dollars in hospitals for treatment that may fail eventually. As
          already stated earlier, doctors may be unaware of the tactics of eliminating BPH. Therefore, giving the right
          medication to fight the root cause of the condition remains a nightmare. However, with the Prostate Protocol
          in hand, any man with an enlarged prostate is guaranteed healing within 3 three weeks. Yes, 21 days are enough
          to shrink the prostate while using the system. However, the results may vary because men are different. This
          implies some may receive the products within the expected time, and they might delay to others. In simple
          terms, men using Prostate Protocol should exercise patience at all costs to get the results. The Prostate
          Protocol is available on Blue Heroin Health News website. Visit the site to grab the system today for a
          healthy prostate gland. The program remains the only solution regardless of the stage the BPH might be in.</p>
        <h2>What To Expect In The Program</h2>
        <p>The Prostate Protocol Program has a lot of great news for men suffering from BPH. It should be noted that the
          system is available <a title="Disease-modifying therapy trials in PD" class="intexttaglink" data-tid="8738"
            href="/in-pd.html">in PDF</a> format. One can therefore access it for offline use. The 164 pages guide is
          dedicated to ensuring one gets enough knowledge and tips for curing BPH. In the presence of the Prostate
          Protocol, having enlarged prostate glands is an option. As stated above, thousands of men have already tested
          the system, and the results were impressive. Thousands of men worldwide may be unaware of the BPH's signs and
          symptoms. Therefore, the program sheds light on what any man can know he is a victim of BPH. Below is what men
          suffering from BPH should expect in the program.</p>
        <h2>Bph Symptoms At A Glance</h2>
        <p>Telling the symptoms of BPH may be difficult for a newbie to the condition. However, knowing the prostate
          gland enlargement earlier is essential. It helps look for the cure earlier before the damages are done.
          Reportedly, BPH has severe consequences, including <a title="Natural Treatment for Kidney Failure"
            class="intexttaglink" data-tid="2776" href="/kidney-failure.html">Kidney Failure</a>. Therefore, identifying
          the symptoms earlier puts one in a better position to evade the consequences. The symptoms of this condition
          mainly come in the form of urinary complications. They include;</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong><em>Frequent urgency to pee;</em></strong> This is a common symptom many with BPH will see. At
            this point, the prostate glands have become enlarged, and therefore urine can flow out anytime. Experiencing
            the urge to pee is a disturbing situation, especially during the night or in important meetings. To add
            insult to an injury, it can happen anytime during the night. This may cause inconveniences to anyone living
            in insecure regions.</li>
          <li><strong><em>Difficulty in urinating;</em></strong> Take a minute and think about the discomfort caused by
            a full bladder. That is not even an issue; the problem is experiencing difficulties in urinating. It is a
            terrible situation, right? Many men are going through this around the world. Medication has failed in many
            scenarios, and the victims have remained hopeless. However, with the Prostate Protocol, the tables can be
            turned. Think about those comfortable urinating sessions before life took another turn. Yes, the condition
            can be reversed with the help of the Prostate Protocol. More interestingly, the system is relatively cheap
            compared to the money one may spend in a hospital. The sun is shining now. Men suffering from BPH should
            take this advantage to build their hay.</li>
          <li><strong><em>Involuntary starting or stopping of urination;</em></strong> Under normal circumstances,
            starting or stopping urination should be voluntary. However, for men with BPH, matters are quite the
            opposite. The condition denies them the authority to control their urination. For instance, one can be
            urinating the urine suddenly stops coming out. Keep in mind at this point, and the bladder is not completely
            emptied. One, therefore, remains uncomfortable until the urine involuntary starts again. Another
            disappointing scenario is the unintended starting of urination. This one becomes even worse when one is in
            public. Shame and embarrassment are what follows to men may experience such in public places. For those who
            have tried various cures without success, the Prostate Protocol may be the right and final solution.
            Ignoring the program brings nothing good rather than worsening the situation. Remember, many men with the
            same prostate gland complication are now cured. Why take even a minute to think about investing in Prostate
            Protocol? I short, purchasing the program is a no-brainer decision. The Prostate Protocol contains more
            symptoms men suffering BPH must know. Purchasing the system is the only way to gain access to the other many
            symptoms. Hurry up to grab the system before it's too late.</li>
        </ul>

                alt="Image result for BPH symptoms" data-noaft="1" /></a></strong></p>
        <h2>Common Causes Of Prostatic Overgrowth</h2>
        <p>Before looking at the causes of Prostatic overgrowth, one should know what prostrate is. The Prostrate is
          part of the male reproductive system comprising the penis, <a title="Naturally Increase Testicle Size"
            class="intexttaglink" data-tid="6634" href="/testicles.html">testicles</a>, prostate, and semi-vesicles.
          Prostrate is connected to the endocrine, nervous, immune, and vascular systems. If affected with BPH,
          prostrate might also negatively affect these other systems. However, the primary causes of Prostatic
          Overgrowth include hormonal depletion, oxidative stress, excessive inflammation, and wrong apoptosis.</p>
        <p>Moreover, imbalance of sex hormones, including androgen, Estrogen, and progesterone, also cause Prostatic
          Overgrowth. The adrenal hormone also impacts the prostrate overgrowth when imbalanced. As the BPH grows,
          prostatic cells malfunction resulting in prostatic overgrowth. Reportedly, all men are vulnerable to BPH
          regardless of age, genes, or lifestyle. Therefore, knowing the symptoms of the condition may help prevent it
          early.</p>
        <h2>Risk Factors &nbsp;</h2>
        <p>Risk factors are aspects that expose one to BPH or make the condition severe. They are classified into <a
            title="Natural Dietary Supplements" class="intexttaglink" data-tid="8014" href="/dietary.html">Dietary</a>,
          lifestyle, and environmental factors. Dietary factors include;</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong><em>High Sugar Consumption; </em></strong>Consuming sugary foods can cause serious health
            problems. Among the complications caused by consuming sugars is BPH. Yes, despite the sweetness, sugar has
            fatal side effects when consumed in large quantities. One should therefore avoid taking too much sugar.</li>
          <li><strong><em>Too much Salt;</em></strong> Salt consumption varies in people. Some take it in large
            quantities, while others prefer small amounts. In both cases, there might be health complications. In men,
            too much salt increases the risk of getting BPH. One should therefore regulate salt consumption to avoid the
            risk of getting BPH.</li>
          <li><strong><em>Low Proteins and fiber diet;</em></strong> A balanced diet is not complete without proteins
            and fiber. Thousands of men ignore these foods and end up suffering in the end. Foods rich in proteins
            include Poultry, Lean Meats, Fish, Eggs, and Dairy products. Men should be objective when it comes to diet.
            Eating right has more benefits people may not be aware of. Fiber is also called roughage. It plays a vital
            role in feeding the depleted gut bacteria in the body. Foods rich in fiber include Beans, Broccoli, Berries,
            Fruits, and Grains.</li>
          <li><strong><em>Excessive Stimulant consumption; </em></strong>Stimulant products include energy drinks and
            those containing caffeine. When taken in low quantity, these products are suitable for one's health.
            However, in large amounts, they can cause severe impacts, including BPH. Men should therefore reduce the
            stimulant intake to stay safe from BPH. More dietary risk factors are in the Prostate Protocol. Purchase the
            system to gain knowledge on the dietary BPH risk factors.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Lifestyle-Related Risk Factors</h2>
        <p>His lifestyle also determines the health of a man. A simple lifestyle reduces the risk of health
          complications, including BPH. On most occasions, many men may not be aware of various lifestyles' effects on
          their health. Furthermore, some copy other's lifestyles, unknowing of the later consequences. The
          Lifestyle-Related Risk Factors include;</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong><em>Alcohol consumption; </em></strong>Undoubtedly, more than a significant fraction of adult men
            take alcohol. Regardless of the quantity, alcohol can cause serious health problems in the body. As a risk
            factor, alcohol consumption causes the elimination of gut bacteria. This, in turn, results in overgrowing of
            the prostate. Statistics aside, men consuming alcohol are at high risk of getting BPH. As already stated,
            quantity does not matter. Avoiding alcohol is, therefore, the best solution to stay safe from prostate
            enlargement. Any man who cares about his health should be ready to quit taking alcohol. One who cares about
            his life should give health the priority. After all, some lifestyles are not essential as one can do without
            them.</li>
          <li><strong><em>Smoking;</em></strong> Smoking is another habit that cost men their health. Apart from causing
            prostate enlargement, smoking also damages the lungs. This may, in turn, resulting in lung cancer. On most
            occasions, men smoke Marijuana and Cigarettes. The two serve different purposes to men. Cigarettes are
            mainly for leisure and making one warm during the cold seasons. However, Marijuana is commonly used for
            meditation. Yes, they may have personal benefits to those who use them. However, their side effects may be
            severe.</li>
          <li><strong><em>Sedentary Lifestyle; </em></strong>Men in Sedentary lifestyles do little or no exercise.
            Mostly, such men engage in most activities while seated. The better part of a man's day in this kind of a
            lifestyle is spent on reading, watching, or playing video games. A Sedentary lifestyle is associated with
            gaining overweight bodies. Who does not know the side harm of an overweight body? First, 0one becomes at
            risk of diabetes attacks. The effects may go further, causing the enlargement of the prostate. Therefore, as
            many think a sedentary lifestyle is luxurious, its health consequences may be severe.</li>
          <li><strong><em>Steroids; </em></strong>Steroids are artificial chemicals that function like natural human
            hormones. They are mainly used to stimulate muscle growth. What comes to your mind when you hear muscle
            growth? The quantity of steroids used does not matter. This is because the man overdosing on these chemicals
            can get a prostate enlargement. Also, the one using them in the right quantities remains at risk of BPH
            attacks. The most common problems associated with steroids include Kidney failure, liver damage or tumor,
            high blood pressure, and heart enlargement. It is now evident taking short cuts to building muscles to have
            consequences. Hard work and determination in the gym remains the best solution for avoiding BPH.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Environmental Risk Factors</h2>
        <p>Keeping the environment clean necessary for human beings. Ignorance of the environment has become one of the
          factors causing health complications in men. Many campaigns are conducted worldwide are conducted to enlighten
          men on living in safe surroundings. Until now, much has not been done to maintain a clean environment.
          However, tables may turn in the future as everyone would have known the importance of safe surroundings.
          Environmental risk factors include;</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong><em>Pesticides, herbicides, and Fungicides; </em></strong>Pesticides are chemicals used to control
            pests. They are both dangerous to pests and humans. Herbicides are chemicals used for controlling the growth
            of unwanted planes. They are mostly used in the agricultural sector to increase farm harvests. Fungicides
            are chemicals used to prevent fungi growth and their spores. Special measures must be observed when spraying
            these chemicals. For instance, one should wear protective clothes that prevent the penetration of chemicals
            into the body.</li>
          <li><strong><em>Pollutants;</em></strong> companies mainly release pollutants. Mostly, they are channeled in
            rivers or emitted in the sky. Men take the pollutants indirectly and unknowingly. When in the body, the
            pollutants cause severe problems, including BPH. It is, therefore, better to always take well-treated water
            and washed foods to avoid many inconveniences.</li>
          <li><strong><em>Excess EMF and Radiation; </em></strong>Electromotive Force, abbreviated as EMF, is the energy
            per unit released by an energy source. Undoubtedly, more than 80 percent of the world&rsquo;s population has
            access to electricity and electrical gadgets. This shows how people are exposed to more EMF, and men are in
            danger in this case. Radiation is the emission of energy in the form of waves to the surrounding. Technology
            came with advantages and side effects too. For instance, many radiation sources are the latest technological
            equipment. Microwaves, computers, cell phones, and wireless WI-FI routers are the familiar sources of
            radiation.</li>
          <li>Moreover, ultraviolet light and X-rays expose one to radiation. Other risk factors include malnutrition,
            aging, pubertal development, and significant stressors. Purchase the Prostate Protocol system to learn more
            about the risk factors.</li>

        <h2>Bph Diagnosis</h2>
        <p>Realizing the existence of BPH is challenging. The signs may reveal themselves after years of damage to the
          prostate. In the end, one will start experiencing urinary symptoms. At this point, one should visit the
          hospital for diagnosis. It begins by observing the condition's signs and symptoms. However, the doctor may
          further check the medical history of the patient and conduct a prostate examination. Additionally, one's
          overall state of health may be assessed based on the symptoms. However, one not sure about the BPH symptoms
          can skip the diagnosis and go for lab testing.</p>
        <h2>Urinary Complaints And Early Warning Signs </h2>
        <p>Understanding the early signs helps prevent BPH before the condition worsens. However, doctors will recommend
          one to wait until the symptoms manifest. This is dangerous because the prostate&rsquo;s situation will be
          beyond treatment. Having a personal medical diary is a simple way to monitor the early BPH signs. The journal
          will help identify the variances in health, including <a title="Natural Remedies for Food Cravings"
            class="intexttaglink" data-tid="6472" href="/food-cravings.html">food cravings</a>, mood, and stress levels.
          Finally, one may be able to notice the early signs of BPH and reduce risk exposures. For one with persistent
          BPH symptoms, consulting a doctor is still important. The information helps in better following and
          understanding of the Prostate Protocol.</p>
        <h2>Medical History And Evaluation</h2>
        <p>Consulting a doctor after spotting early signs of BPH is essential. Here, one gets the medical history that
          helps to understand the condition further. The risk factors mentioned above can also help one know prostate
          health. However, some early signs may not imply the presence of BPH. For instance, Chronic Urinary problems
          are also signs of BPE, prostatic inflammation, and malignant growth. Therefore, the medical history of the
          doctor can help one learn a lot about BPH.</p>
        <h2>Urine Analysis</h2>
        <p>Urine analysis mainly focuses on testing for the <a title="Urinary Tract Infection Alternative Treatment"
            class="intexttaglink" data-tid="8134" href="/uti.html">UTI</a> presence. UTI is a common causative agent of
          prostatic inflammation resulting in urinary symptoms. If UTI symptoms manifest frequently, the condition is
          likely to be chronic prostatitis and not BPH. However, chronic prostatitis is a risk factor for getting BPH.
          Moreover, the presence of blood in urine may not also indicate prostate enlargement. This is because blood
          traces in urine is also a sign of bladder <a title="Natural Cancer Remedies That Work" class="intexttaglink"
            data-tid="6758" href="/cancer.html">cancer</a>. If the situation persists, one should conduct an ultrasound
          imaging to check if the prostate has the problem or not.</p>
        <h2>Physical Prostrate Examination</h2>
        <p>The doctor conducted the Physical Prostrate examination to find out if the prostate is under attack or not. A
          large part of the examination's data is used to make the medical history.&nbsp; Doctors recommend yearly
          checking of the prostrate to find if there is a presence of urinary symptoms. However, this examination may
          not be vital as it may fail to give reliable results. After all, blood testing can also give quality results
          that will provide direction about BPH. Reportedly, Physical Prostrate examinations only find 70% of tumors in
          the prostate. The test focuses on the prostate gland's rear lobe as everyone knows BPH does not attack this
          part. Signs including frequent peeing during the night indicate chances of the person suffering from BPH, BPE,
          or chronic Prostatitis. If the patient does not trust the examination results, then lab testing can be another
          best option. Laboratory tests have high accuracy, and they give a clear picture of the prostate has been
          attacked or not.</p>
        <h2>Understanding Bph</h2>
        <p>Undoubtedly, doctors do not understand BPH today. It is because they try curing the condition while putting a
          lot of focus on sex hormones. According to research, men get BPH regardless of their sexual hormones state.
          The wrong understanding of the condition has made it almost untreatable. Ancient medicine links BPH with
          aging. However, the Prostrate Protocol contains essential details of this condition. The information available
          in this system cannot be found from other sources. Therefore, one who purchases Prostrate Protocol will gain
          the knowledge even doctors are not aware of.</p>
        <h2>The Role Of Testosterone In Normal Prostatic Function</h2>
        <p>Testosterone hormone is also known as androgen. It is one of the hormones that, when it undergoes imbalance,
          results in BPH.&nbsp; Testosterone is the primary hormone needed for optimum performance of the prostate
          gland. Moreover, it regulates the cellular activities in the gland. Prostatic cells in the gland have androgen
          receptors that coordinate androgen circulation. Androgen receptors are responsible for regulating
          contractions, secretions, and the well-being of the prostate.</p>
        <p>Moreover, the Testosterone hormone ensures the fertility of one is maintained. Regular circulation of the
          hormone is required in the prostate for its survival. The proper functioning of the receptors is therefore
          essential, ensuring the gland remains operational. As already stated, having <a
            title="The Cause of Low Testosterone" class="intexttaglink" data-tid="6629"
            href="/low-testosterone.html">low testosterone</a> hormone levels is dangerous because it paves the way for
          BPH. However, this does not happen quickly because the body fights to replace the hormone. Total depletion of
          the hormone results in the body using other mechanisms for the survival of the gland. Continuous use of the
          mechanisms may finally cause BPH. At this point, the person will start experiencing urinary tract symptoms. In
          simple terms, a well-maintained level of Testosterone and functional androgen receptors guarantees a healthy
          prostate gland.</p>
        <h2>The Role Of Estrogen Receptors In Bph</h2>
        <p>Both androgens and estrogens have receptors. The two types of estrogen receptors include alpha(ER-a) and
          beta(ER-b). Activation of alpha receptors increases growth and inflammation. However, activation of beta
          receptors stops growth and increase apoptosis.</p>
        <p><strong><a class="intexttaglink" data-tid="12019" href="/overactive-bladder.html">Overactive Bladder</a> and
            Prostatic Smooth Muscle Contractions&nbsp; </strong></p>
        <p>Bladder expansion occurs when one holds urine for a long time. The detrusor muscle is responsible for
          enabling the bladder to prolong urine retention. However, in the end, the muscle's performance may decline,
          resulting in incontinence. Neural stimulation is said to be the likely cause of the declining performance of
          detrusor muscles. The condition is called an overactive bladder. If the person with this condition visits the
          hospital, the doctor may prescribe conventional drugs.&nbsp; The drugs are mainly dedicated to preventing the
          <a title="Relaxation Techniques" class="intexttaglink" data-tid="9431" href="/relaxation.html">relaxation</a>
          of the detrusor muscle. However, the drugs may stimulate prostate enlargement.
        </p>
        <p>Furthermore,&nbsp; the drugs may fail to give better results once the body gets adapted to them. The Prostate
          Protocol offers a simple and reliable solution for a healthy bladder. In the system, one will find natural
          antispasmodics that help the bladder function well.&nbsp; Moreover, they cure BPH, UTI and maintain sex
          hormones levels. The solution may not help the person with an overactive bladder regain it completely.&nbsp;
          However, with the help of pelvic floor exercises, regaining full control of the bladder is possible.</p>

        <h2>Inflammation And Cellular Communication</h2>
        <p>Inflammation is the group of cells produced by cells to identify malfunctions and measures to counter them.
          Increased inflammation is one of the causes the prostate enlargement causes. Reportedly, improper functioning
          of the <a title="Immune System Boosters" class="intexttaglink" data-tid="3675" href="#">immune system</a>
          causes unbalanced inflammation. Cytokines are the main
          components of inflammatory response. The inflammatory response is stimulated by minerals, vitamins, amino
          acids, and growth factors.</p>
        <h2>Specific Immune Profiles Associated With Bph</h2>
        <p>BPH is linked to a variety of immune profiles depending on the intensity of the condition. T cells are the
          primary cells found in the prostatic region. T cells are part of the white blood cells sourced from the thymus
          gland. CD4 T cells, the leading T cells, are mainly available in the prostate. Undoubtedly, the CD4 T cells
          are responsible for unbalances inflammation. The presence of these cells ensures the prostate gland is not
          exposed to pathogen attacks. Moreover, the cells help maintain the <a class="intexttaglink" data-tid="9140"
            href="#">allergy</a> hypersensitivity activities. The primary T cells involved in ensuring the
          prostrate are free from pathogen attacks are CD8 T cells.</p>
        <h2>Metabolic Instability</h2>
        <p>Metabolism is the chemical reactions that occur in the body, ensuring the well being of a person. Metabolic
          diseases, including <a title="Home Remedies To Treat Obesity Naturally" class="intexttaglink" data-tid="8026"
            href="#">obesity</a> and <a title="Natural remedies to reduce belly fat caused by metabolic syn"
            class="intexttaglink" data-tid="867" href="#">metabolic syndrome</a>, stimulate
          prostate enlargement. On most occasions, metabolic conditions reduce the levels of Testosterone hormone. Also,
          the conditions may further cause chronic inflammations. Eventually, the body will get hormonal imbalances that
          pave the way to BPH. Reportedly, men with BPH experience metabolic conditions most of the time.</p>
        <p><strong><a title="How to Cure Diabetes and Get Off Insulin" class="intexttaglink" data-tid="5994"
              href="#">Insulin</a> Resistance</strong></p>
        <p>Insulin resistance is a condition that involves the body muscles and cells not responding well to insulin.
          The body may also fail to absorb glucose from the blood if the condition worsens. Despite being a major cause
          of type two <a title="Reverse Your Diabetes Today" class="intexttaglink" data-tid="5992"
            href="#">diabetes</a>, insulin resistance also plays a part in BPH. It unbalances the sex
          hormones exposing one to a high risk of BPH attacks. The insulin receptors that connect to the pancreas become
          destroyed, resulting in insulin resistance. As the situation worsens, one may end up contracting chronic <a
            title="Guide To Beating Hypoglycemia" class="intexttaglink" data-tid="6266" href="#">hypoglycemia</a>. The
          growth of insulin resistance further stimulates stress
          response resulting in smooth muscle contraction in the body. With the onset of the stress response, the person
          can quickly get chronic stress. Chronic stress may eventually expose one to diabetes, BPH, and metabolic
          syndrome. Insulin resistance is likely to be a result of reduced levels of Testosterone hormone. Moreover, if
          the growth factor production shoots up, the person can experience insulin resistance.</p>
        <h2>Obesity</h2>
        <p>Obesity can be well defined as a condition resulting from the accumulation of too many fats in the body. One
          with Obesity is considered to be eating a lot with little or no exercise. This condition can also be linked to
          an imbalance in the body. With more fats in the body, the levels of testosterone hormone suddenly drop. The
          situation worsens as the remaining Testerosterone is changed to Estrogen by the <a
            title="Natural Exercise Hormone Transforms Fat Cells" class="intexttaglink" data-tid="7666" href="#">fat
            cells</a>. When one's gut is unhealthy, metabolic imbalances occur. The
          imbalances then result in Obesity. However, the person can exercise to regain the gut's health and promote the
          hormones' functioning.</p>

        <p><strong>Gut Dysbiosis, Gut Inflammation, and Metabolic Instability</strong></p>
        <p>Probiotic bacteria found in the gut plays an essential role in ensuring one stays safe from BPH. The bacteria
          ensure the right <a title="Naturally Increase Testosterone Levels" class="intexttaglink" data-tid="6628"
            href="#">Testosterone levels</a> are maintained. Moreover, it helps prevent the
          onset of metabolic diseases and malfunctioning of the immune system. More interestingly, these essential gut
          bacteria help humans digest the food well and absorb the nutrients in the required proportions. An imbalanced
          gut gives room for the penetration of harmful bacteria that endangers the body. &nbsp;For instance, the
          imbalanced gut results in metabolic instability. The gut bacteria have a proper connection with the immune
          system. It helps the body's defense system become inflammatory if there is a bacterial attack in a process
          called gut Dysbiosis. Reportedly, gut Dysbiosis may result in Obesity, diabetes, insulin resistance, and
          hyperlipidemia. In optimum performance, the gut bacteria also help the body get the fats. Moreover, the
          bacteria also improve cholesterol control. As if that is not enough, the bacteria ensure the nutritional value
          in the food one takes becomes extra bioavailable.</p>
        <h2>Common Cardiovascular Bph Contributions</h2>
        <p>The <a class="intexttaglink" data-tid="18418" href="#">cardiovascular system</a> is
          linked to prostate problems and other diseases. The cardiovascular system forms an essential route for the
          passage of materials in the body. Improper functioning of this system endangers the prostrate in various ways.
          For instance, it may result in calcification of arteries, anemia, <a class="intexttaglink" data-tid="5609"
            href="#">hypertension</a>, and weak <a class="intexttaglink" data-tid="18416" href="#">blood vessels</a>.
        </p>
        <p><strong>The relationship between Sex hormones, Arterial Calcification and Aging</strong></p>
        <p>Arguably, there is a connection between sex hormones, Arterial calcification, and aging. According to
          research, the <a title="Healthy Living: How to Stop the Aging Process" class="intexttaglink" data-tid="6855"
            href="#">aging process</a>, calcification, autophagy, and mitochondrial reactions are
          connected to hormonal activities. Reportedly, women are more likely to get brain calcification that causes <a
            title="5 Steps to Reverse Dementia" class="intexttaglink" data-tid="6870" href="#">dementia</a>
          and unhealthy bones when they grow old. As for men, they are likely to get heart and smooth muscle
          calcification. Brains, Estrogen mainly targets to prevent toxins from attacking the brain. However, it slows
          down autophagy and clearance. Testosterone hormone promotes the support of neurotoxicity through autophagy.
          This eventually brains from calcification. In the heart, Estrogen stimulates autophagy and prevents oxidative
          stress. Testosterone is also essential in the heart. In men, the hormone helps control calcium in the cardiac
          tissues. Proper functioning of the androgen receptors prevents aging in men. It purposely signals the
          Testosterone hormone that helps keep men young. Malfunctioning of these receptors may also cause the onset of
          prostatic hyperplasia. Evidently, Estrogen is more useful to humans. However, Testosterone is still essential,
          ensuring men's protection at old age. Balanced sex hormones help the heart, bones, and blood vessels to
          function well. This eventually reduces the risks of cardiovascular issues.</p>
        <h2>Risk Factors That Provoke Prostatic Hypertrophy</h2>
        <p>These risk factors are grouped into dietary, lifestyle-related, and environmental factors.</p>
        <h2>Dietary Risk Factors</h2>
        <p>Dietary factors involve energy, nutritional and hormonal metabolism. Undoubtedly, imbalances in dietary
          factors result in BPH. They include;</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong><em>Low Protein and Fiber diet; </em></strong>The person is talking food low with low proteins
            risks aging and reducing Testosterone levels. People who realized the importance of protein end up consuming
            a lot of animal meat. Yes, it is a reliable source of animal meat. However, the gut may not digest the
            proteins from animal meat well. Eventually, improper breakdown of these specific proteins may result in
            inflammation of the gut profile. Therefore, one must take 5 % o animal proteins or less and take more of
            plant-based proteins. Purchase the Prostatic Protocol to learn more about dietary risk factors.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Lifestyle-related risk factors</h2>
        <p><strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong>These factors depend on how a person spends time. Unfortunately, many are
          unaware of these factors that might further affect the cellular metabolism of the person. They include;</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong><em>Alcohol consumption; </em></strong>Alcohol consumption is also associated with prostate
            enlargement. Alcohol hinders estrogen activities resulting in gut Dysbiosis, liver impairment, low
            production of Testosterone, and nutrient deficiencies. More lifestyle-related risk factors are available in
            Prostrate Protocol. Purchase the system to gain this vital knowledge.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Environmental Risk Factors</h2>
        <p>Human beings and the environment are close and dependent in many ways. Harmful compounds exposed in the
          background are dangerous to humans. Environmental risks result in hormonal imbalance, increased inflammation,
          and destruction of the gut. Below are some of the environmental risk factors.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong><em>Pollutants; </em></strong>Pollutants can either be air or water-born. Air-born pollutants are
            more dangerous because they contain more toxic substances. Metals and carbon-monoxide are some of the
            hazardous compounds found in air pollutants. Fluoride is one of the most deadly substances available in
            polluted water. The compound is dangerous in that it may end up destroying the gut bacteria. Therefore,
            people living in areas with air pollution should install air purifiers. A water filter will also be
            necessary for people living in places with polluted water. Purchase the Prostrate Protocol to learn more
            about the environmental risk factors.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Pros Of Prostrate Protocol</h2>

                Some websites will try to draw you in by claiming you can download Scott Davis’ The Prostate Protocol
                for free. Their page titles might be something like, “The Prostate Protocol Free Download PDF“. Then,
                you get to the site, and they try to justify it by saying it’s “risk-free” and then point you to the
                website where it’s $49.00. Well, to me risk-free and FREE aren’t the same thing! While you can
                technically try The Prostate Protocol risk-free because of the 60-day money back guarantee, you still
                need the money up front to buy it in the first place so it isn’t free. The Prostate Protocol is not a
                free program and any site claiming a free download is either not being totally honest with you or is
                providing illegal copies, neither of which is good. </div>

                This is indicative of sites that usually use a title to their page that says something like, “The
                Prostate Protocol: Another SCAM!?!” or “The Prostate Protocol: Is Scott Davis a Scammer?” or something
                of that nature. In other words, when you search for The Prostate Protocol in Google or another search
                engine, these sites show up with those types of titles in the listings.
                Sometimes these sites will also use what I call the “Fear Factor” in their headlines which is something
                like, “The Prostate Protocol: OMG So Bad!”. This is often nothing more than an attempt to draw you into
                their site by making you think they used the product and had a really bad experience with it.
                How do I know these are fake and not real scam alerts or legitimate complaints? Because the title cries
                SCAM!!!!! or a really horrible experience, but then you go to the page and read the review and it’s
                always an extremely positive, glowing review about how great The Prostate Protocol is. In these
                instances, they only use the word SCAM to try and draw you into their site because they know if they say
                something is a scam or a terrible program, you’ll probably click on their link to find out more about
                it, right?
                A legitimate bad experience or a real scam alert to help protect consumers is one thing, but don’t fall
                for this type of trickery and trust your gut when the headline/page title and review don’t match. No
                real The Prostate Protocol review will cry SCAM or claim it’s a terrible program in the title only to
                offer up a review that says the complete opposite. </div>

                Another version of this same thing is the fake discount. “Buy through this link for 50% off”. Guess
                what, when you click the link, you go to the website where it’s $49.00, just like it normally is.
                I actually first noticed this one on YouTube where people were making short 30 second videos claiming
                they found discount links to The Prostate Protocol. However, every time I checked one out, it was a huge
                disappointment and offered no discount at all.
                I’ve never claimed to be a super genius when it comes to math, but something about the numbers just
                stinks…let’s see…$49.00 minus 50% discount through your link = $49.00! Don’t fall for these fake
                discount claims. One last thing I’ve seen in regards to this is that sometimes people will try to
                inflate the value of the program on their own site to make it appear like they are giving you a
                discount. For example, they’ll say something like “The Prostate Protocol is normally $196, but buy
                through my link for $49.00, a savings of 75%! ” Just another lie you should watch out for. The price
                will always be $49.00 unless Scott Davis decides to change it himself. If he does, I’ll be sure to let
                everyone know! </div>
